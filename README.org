** About

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] provides a way to toggle visibility of emphasis markers, links, subscripts, and superscripts by customising variables such as ~org-hide-emphasis-markers~. However, it is currently not possible to do this interactively and on a fragment-by-fragment basis. Emphasis and verbatim marker toggling requires reloading the Org buffer; links and sub/superscripts are always toggled in the entire buffer. This package, inspired by [[https://github.com/io12/org-fragtog][org-fragtog]], enables automatic visibility toggling depending on cursor position. Hidden fragment parts appear when the cursor enters a fragment and disappear when it leaves.

** Installation

Git clone this repository and point Emacs to it.

With ~use-package~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package org-appear
    :load-path "/path/to/org-appear-dir")

#+end_src

Alternatively, using ~require~:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (require 'org-appear "/path/to/org-appear.el")

#+end_src

** Usage

The package can be enabled interactively or automatically on org-mode start-up:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-appear-mode)

#+end_src

Automatic toggling of fragments may be enabled by setting ~org-appear-autoemphasis~, ~org-appear-autolinks~, and ~org-appear-autosubmarkers~ custom variables to non-nil. By default, only ~org-appear-autoemphasis~ is enabled. If Org mode custom variables that control visibility of emphasis markers, links, or sub/superscripts are configured to show hidden parts, the respective ~org-appear~ settings do not have an effect.
